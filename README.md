Get all of the dice to be the same number! ðŸŽ²

I've built this game by following Learn React Course on Scrimba and added extra features such as:
- Using dots instead of numbers.
- Using rolls tracker.
- Using timer.
- Saving the best roll and best time to localStorage (Browser API) to keep data until it's cleared from the browser.
